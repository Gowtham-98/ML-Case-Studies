# HR Employee Attrition

## About the Dataset
HR Analytics helps us with interpreting organizational data. It finds the people-related trends in the data and allows the HR Department to take the appropriate steps to keep the organization running smoothly and profitably. Attrition in a corporate setup is one of the complex challenges that the people managers and the HRs personnel have to deal with.

Interestingly, Machine Learning models can be deployed to predict potential attrition cases, helping the appropriate HR Personnel take the necessary steps to retain the employee.
